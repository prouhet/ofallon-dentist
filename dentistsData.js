// FAQ Data
const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right dentist for my family?",
    answer: "When choosing a dentist, consider factors like location, office hours, services offered, and whether they treat patients of all ages. Check reviews, ask for recommendations, and consider scheduling a consultation to meet the dentist and staff before making your decision."
  },
  {
    question: "What dental insurance plans are accepted by most O'Fallon dentists?",
    answer: "Most dentists in O'Fallon accept major insurance plans including Delta Dental, MetLife, Cigna, Aetna, and Blue Cross Blue Shield. Many also accept CareCredit and offer in-house payment plans. Always verify coverage with your specific dentist before treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I visit the dentist?",
    answer: "For most people, dentists recommend checkups and cleanings twice a year (every 6 months). However, your dentist may suggest more frequent visits if you have specific dental health concerns, gum disease, or are at higher risk for dental problems."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do in case of a dental emergency?",
    answer: "For dental emergencies like severe pain, broken teeth, or infections, contact your dentist immediately for an emergency appointment. Many O'Fallon dentists offer emergency services or can refer you to an emergency dental provider. If you can't reach your dentist and are experiencing severe pain or swelling, visit an urgent care center or emergency room."
  },
  {
    question: "What options are available for dental anxiety?",
    answer: "Many dentists in O'Fallon offer solutions for dental anxiety including nitrous oxide (laughing gas), oral sedation, and IV sedation. Some practices also provide comfort amenities like massage chairs, TVs, or comfort dogs. Discuss your anxiety with potential dentists to find one who specializes in treating anxious patients."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if a dentist is good with children?",
    answer: "Look for dentists who specifically mention pediatric services or family dentistry. Check reviews from other parents, and consider whether the practice has child-friendly amenities or a welcoming environment for kids. Pediatric specialists have additional training specifically for treating children."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment options are typically available?",
    answer: "Most O'Fallon dentists accept major credit cards, insurance, and CareCredit. Many offer payment plans, financing options, or in-house dental savings plans. Some practices also offer special promotions for new patients or discounts for seniors or military families."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which cosmetic dental procedures are right for me?",
    answer: "The best way to determine appropriate cosmetic procedures is through a consultation with a dentist who offers cosmetic services. They can evaluate your specific needs and goals, explain available options (such as whitening, veneers, or orthodontics), and recommend a personalized treatment plan."
  }
